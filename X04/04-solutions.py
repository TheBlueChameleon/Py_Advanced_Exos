# Domain plot: we've eliminated *by far most* of the information that used to
# be in the image! These four small squares are all what's needed to recreate
# an image of this quality. Making them bigger improves the image quality.
# You only need to find a good compromise between compression rate and 
# remaining image quality -- and bam, that's JPEG for you.

# is big, and the error we make gets multiplied by big factors), and after some
# 10 orbits we've noticeably deviated from the true solution.

# open sets, never on the boundary of a region. When evaluating there, scipy
# uses a filler value, which essentially makes the corresponding values 
# useless. You could interpret this as reading matrix entries with negative
# coordinates.
# If you have SciPy Version 1.6.1 or higher, you can make it so that convolve
# uses cyclyical boundary conditions. This will allow you (for this one 
# example) to extend the range of valid cells to the top and bottom row, BUT
# NOT the left/right column.
# For us that does not matter, since we later set the derivative there to zero,
# anyway.
