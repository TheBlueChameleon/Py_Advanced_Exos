\part*{Python Problems 07, Summer 2021}
\section{File System Size Scan}
Write a program that tells you, how much disk space is used by the files in a given directory and its subdirectories. The program should do both, sum up the file sizes within the directory, excluding subdirectories, and the total size of the directory including the files in the subdirectories. The output should recursively list this for all directories under the given start directory.

\emph{Example:}\\
Imagine, on your disk there is a folder named \texttt{Python-Exo-07} with these files:
\begin{minted}{text}
Python-Exo-07
 + 07-problems.pdf         ( 89128 Bytes)
 + 07-solutions.py         (  5134 Bytes)
 + Folder-1
 |  + notes.txt            (   314 Bytes)  
 |  + funny.jpg            (155964 Bytes)
 + Folder-2
    + world-domination.txt (     3 Bytes)
    + Folder-2-1
      + I-love-Python.dat  (   666 Bytes)
\end{minted}

Then your output should look like this:
\begin{minted}{text}
251209 Bytes in Python-Exo-07, thereof   94262 Bytes directly in the directory
156278 Bytes in Folder-1     , thereof  156278 Bytes directly in the directory
   669 Bytes in Folder-2     , thereof       3 Bytes directly in the directory
   666 Bytes in Folder-2-1   , thereof     666 Bytes directly in the directory
\end{minted}

Make it so that the start folder can be passed as a command line parameter. For example, on my machine I can produce this console output:
